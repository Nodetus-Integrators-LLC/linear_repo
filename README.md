## Framework Philosophy

This framework is built on three core principles:

1. **Narrative-Driven Development**
   - Every project tells a story
   - Clear beginning, middle, and end
   - Meaningful milestones as plot points
   - Satisfying project conclusion

2. **Structured Progress**
   - Well-defined layers and stages
   - Clear issue categorization
   - Domain-specific considerations
   - Measurable advancement

3. **Balanced Flexibility**
   - Adaptable templates
   - Customizable workflows
   - Scalable structures
   - Reusable patterns

## Current Features

### Labels
- Domain-specific categorization
- Issue type classification
- Clear labeling guidelines
- Best practices for each category

### Layers

# Requirements Documentation

This directory contains detailed requirements documentation for our project features and enhancements.

## 📁 Structure

- `02_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Template and active requirements documents
- Each requirement document follows our standardized format to ensure consistency and completeness

## 🔄 Requirements Process

1. **Creation**: New requirements are created using the template format
2. **Review**: Requirements are reviewed for completeness and clarity
3. **Validation**: Stakeholders verify the requirements meet business needs
4. **Implementation**: Development team uses requirements as reference
5. **Updates**: Requirements are updated as needed during development

## 📝 Template Sections

- **Problem Statement**: Clear description of the user pain point
- **Proposed Solution**: Approach to solving the problem
- **Value Delivery**: Business value and expected impact
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria
- **Dependencies**: Required resources or prerequisites
- **Progression Indicators**: Development readiness checks
- **Related Documents**: Links to supporting materials

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. Keep requirements SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
2. Include quantifiable metrics where possible
3. Update requirements as new information emerges
4. Link to relevant design documents and discovery issues
5. Maintain clear acceptance criteria

## ✅ Validation Checklist

Before marking requirements as complete, ensure:
- [ ] All sections are filled out
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [ ] Dependencies are identified
- [ ] Business value is clearly stated
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed and approved
