# Milestones

Milestones represent significant checkpoints in a project's journey, combining product deliverables with client interactions to create a cohesive narrative of progress. Like any good story, projects have a clear beginning, middle, and end, with key turning points that drive the narrative forward.

## Purpose

Milestones serve to:
- Mark significant achievements and progress
- Structure the project narrative
- Align stakeholder expectations
- Create natural review points
- Drive project momentum
- Celebrate team accomplishments

## Recurring Elements

While projects follow a narrative arc toward completion, certain tasks and meetings recur throughout the journey. These recurring elements provide rhythm and consistency to the project while supporting progress toward milestones.

### Types of Recurring Items

1. **Regular Client Touchpoints**
   - Weekly status updates
   - Sprint reviews
   - Monthly steering committee
   - Quarterly business reviews

2. **Development Ceremonies**
   - Daily standups
   - Sprint planning
   - Backlog refinement
   - Retrospectives

3. **Maintenance Activities**
   - Code reviews
   - Security scans
   - Performance monitoring
   - Backup verification

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automated testing
   - Code quality checks
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Environment health checks

### Integration with Milestones

Recurring tasks should:
- Support milestone objectives
- Provide regular checkpoints
- Maintain project momentum
- Surface issues early
- Enable continuous improvement
