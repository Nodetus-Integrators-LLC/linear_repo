# Development Stage Architecture

This directory contains the documentation for our development lifecycle stages. The stages represent the progression of work from initial discovery to final release, ensuring a systematic and quality-driven development process.

## Stage Overview

Our development process is divided into six distinct stages, numbered from 00 to 05, representing the chronological progression of work items through the development lifecycle.

### Stage Progression

```
Stage 00: Discovery
    ↓
Stage 01: Requirements
    ↓
Stage 02: Design
    ↓
Stage 03: Development
    ↓
Stage 04: Quality Assurance
    ↓
Stage 05: Release
```

### Stage Flow

Each stage represents a distinct phase in the development process, with clear entry and exit criteria. Work items should progress through these stages sequentially, though some parallel work and iteration may occur within stages.

## Stage Descriptions

### [00 - Discovery](./00_discovery)
Initial exploration and understanding of the problem space, gathering context and identifying opportunities.

### [01 - Requirements](./01_requirements)
Detailed specification of what needs to be built, including functional and non-functional requirements.

### [02 - Design](./02_design)
Technical and architectural design decisions, including system design, UI/UX design, and implementation planning.

### [03 - Development](./03_dev)
Active implementation phase where the solution is built according to the requirements and design specifications.

### [04 - Quality Assurance](./04_qa)
Comprehensive testing and validation to ensure the solution meets quality standards and requirements.

### [05 - Release](./05_release)
Final preparation and deployment of the solution to production environments.

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential Progression**: Work typically flows from one stage to the next
2. **Quality Gates**: Each stage has clear entry and exit criteria
3. **Iteration**: Feedback loops may require returning to previous stages
4. **Documentation**: Each stage should maintain proper documentation
5. **Validation**: Each stage includes verification of work quality

## Best Practices

1. **Stage Entry/Exit Criteria**
   - Clear definition of when work can enter a stage
   - Explicit criteria for completing a stage
   - Documentation of stage transitions

2. **Quality Management**
   - Regular reviews at each stage
   - Clear acceptance criteria
   - Continuous validation of work

3. **Communication**
   - Regular status updates
   - Clear handoff procedures between stages
   - Stakeholder involvement at appropriate stages

4. **Risk Management**
   - Early identification of risks
   - Mitigation strategies at each stage
   - Regular risk assessment

5. **Documentation**
   - Maintain stage-specific documentation
   - Track decisions and changes
   - Keep stakeholders informed

## Common Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. Skipping stages or quality gates
2. Insufficient documentation between stages
3. Lack of stakeholder involvement
4. Inadequate testing and validation
5. Poor communication between stages

## Getting Started

To work effectively with this stage-based process:

1. Identify the current stage of your work item
2. Review the stage-specific requirements
3. Ensure all entry criteria are met
4. Follow stage-specific best practices
5. Meet all exit criteria before progression

## Stage Transitions

Work items should only move to the next stage when:
1. All exit criteria for the current stage are met
2. Entry criteria for the next stage are satisfied
3. Proper documentation is complete
4. Stakeholders have approved the transition
5. Quality requirements are met
