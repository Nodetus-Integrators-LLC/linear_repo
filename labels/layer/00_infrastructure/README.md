# Infrastructure Layer (Layer 00)

The Infrastructure Layer forms the foundation of the application, handling all deployment, build, and operational concerns. This layer is responsible for ensuring the application can run reliably in various environments.

## Key Components

### 1. Containerization & Deployment
- Docker configurations
- Kubernetes manifests
- Cloud infrastructure setup
- Deployment scripts

### 2. Build Configuration
- Build scripts
- Webpack/Vite configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- Asset bundling setup

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions/Jenkins configuration
- Automated testing setup
- Deployment automation
- Quality gates

### 4. Environment Management
- Environment variables configuration
- Secret management
- Configuration files
- Environment-specific settings

### 5. Observability
- Logging setup
- Monitoring configuration
- Performance tracking
- Error tracking integration

## Common Locations
- `/docker`
- `/config`
- `/scripts`
- `/.github`
- `/deploy`

## Best Practices
1. Keep infrastructure as code (IaC)
2. Document all configuration options
3. Use version control for infrastructure changes
4. Implement secure secret management
5. Maintain separate configurations for different environments

## Dependencies
This layer typically has minimal dependencies on other layers but is critical for all layers above it to function properly.

## Notes
- Changes to this layer often require careful testing and validation
- Should follow security best practices
- Should be well-documented for DevOps purposes
