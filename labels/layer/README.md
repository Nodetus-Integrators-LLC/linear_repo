# Application Layer Architecture

This directory contains the documentation for our application's layered architecture. The architecture follows a clean, layered approach that promotes separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability.

## Layer Overview

Our application is divided into six distinct layers, numbered from 00 to 05, where lower numbers represent lower-level infrastructure concerns and higher numbers represent higher-level application concerns.

### Layer Structure

```
Layer 05: Presentation Layer
    ↑
Layer 04: Business Layer
    ↑
Layer 03: Service Layer
    ↑
Layer 02: Persistence Layer
    ↑
Layer 01: Database Layer
    ↑
Layer 00: Infrastructure Layer
```

### Dependencies

The layers follow a strict dependency rule: each layer can only depend on layers below it. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and prevents circular dependencies.

## Layer Descriptions

### [00 - Infrastructure Layer](./00_infrastructure)
The foundation layer that handles deployment, build, and operational concerns. All other layers depend on this layer for their operational needs.

### [01 - Database Layer](./01_database)
Manages database schemas, migrations, and core data structure definitions. Depends only on the Infrastructure layer.

### [02 - Persistence Layer](./02_persistence)
Handles data access patterns and storage operations. Acts as an abstraction between data storage and business logic.

### [03 - Service Layer](./03_service)
Manages external communications, integrations, and cross-cutting concerns. Provides APIs for the business layer.

### [04 - Business Layer](./04_business)
Contains core business logic, rules, and workflows. Orchestrates the application's behavior.

### [05 - Presentation Layer](./05_presentation)
Handles all user interface concerns, including components, layouts, and user interactions.

## Key Principles

1. **Dependency Direction**: Dependencies only flow downward
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility
3. **Abstraction**: Higher layers are abstracted from lower-level details
4. **Independence**: Each layer can be modified independently
5. **Testability**: Layers can be tested in isolation

## Best Practices

1. **Layer Isolation**
   - Keep each layer's code strictly within its boundary
   - Avoid bypassing layers
   - Use proper abstractions between layers

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Never depend on higher layers
   - Minimize dependencies between components in the same layer
   - Use dependency injection when crossing layer boundaries

3. **Communication**
   - Use well-defined interfaces between layers
   - Implement proper error handling at layer boundaries
   - Document cross-layer communication patterns

4. **Testing**
   - Write tests specific to each layer
   - Mock dependencies from lower layers
   - Test layer integration points

5. **Documentation**
   - Keep layer-specific documentation up to date
   - Document layer interfaces and contracts
   - Maintain examples of layer interaction

## Common Anti-patterns to Avoid

1. Skipping layers (e.g., Presentation directly accessing Database)
2. Circular dependencies between layers
3. Mixing concerns across layers
4. Duplicating logic across layers
5. Tight coupling between layers

## Getting Started

To work effectively with this architecture:

1. Identify which layer your code belongs in
2. Review the layer-specific README
3. Follow the layer's best practices
4. Respect dependency rules
5. Write appropriate tests

For detailed information about each layer, please refer to their respective README files in the subdirectories.
