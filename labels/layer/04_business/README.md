# Business Layer (Layer 04)

The Business Layer contains the core business logic, rules, and workflows of the application. It orchestrates the flow of data and operations between different parts of the system while maintaining business rules and domain integrity.

## Key Components

### 1. Domain Entities
- Core business models
- Value objects
- Entity relationships
- Domain events
- Business constants

### 2. Business Logic
- Use cases
- Business rules
- Validation logic
- Workflow orchestration
- Business calculations

### 3. State Management
- Application state
- State containers
- State updates
- State synchronization
- Derived state

### 4. Feature Orchestration
- Feature flags
- Feature coordination
- Complex workflows
- Business processes
- Domain services

### 5. Validation Rules
- Input validation
- Business rule validation
- Cross-field validation
- Complex validation scenarios
- Validation error handling

## Common Locations
- `/src/domain`
- `/src/state`
- `/src/logic`
- `/src/features`
- `/src/workflows`

## Best Practices
1. Follow Domain-Driven Design principles
2. Implement SOLID principles
3. Use clear naming conventions
4. Maintain single responsibility
5. Document business rules
6. Write comprehensive tests

## Dependencies
- Depends on Service Layer for external operations
- Used by Presentation Layer for UI logic
- Independent of specific UI frameworks

## Notes
- Should be framework-agnostic
- Must maintain business rule consistency
- Should be well-tested
- Consider performance implications
- Document complex workflows
