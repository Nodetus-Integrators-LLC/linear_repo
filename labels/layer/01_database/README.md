# Database Layer (Layer 01)

The Database Layer handles all database-related configurations, schemas, and migrations. This layer defines how data is structured and stored, independent of the specific database technology used.

## Key Components

### 1. Schema Definitions
- Data models
- Table structures
- Relationships
- Indexes and constraints
- Type definitions

### 2. Migration Management
- Database migrations
- Version control for schema changes
- Rollback procedures
- Data seeding scripts

### 3. Database Configuration
- Connection settings
- Pool configuration
- Backup procedures
- Replication setup

### 4. Query Definitions
- Base queries
- Common database operations
- Stored procedures
- Views

## Common Locations
- `/db`
- `/schemas`
- `/migrations`
- `/seeds`

## Best Practices
1. Version all schema changes
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Document all migrations
4. Include rollback procedures
5. Use type-safe definitions
6. Keep schemas database-agnostic where possible

## Dependencies
- Depends on Infrastructure Layer for deployment and configuration
- Required by Persistence Layer for data access
- Should be independent of business logic

## Notes
- Changes should be carefully versioned
- Must maintain data integrity
- Should consider performance implications
- Need to handle database-specific features carefully
