# ☂️ Umbrella

## Overview
Umbrellas are 0-point placeholder issues that serve as containers for value delivery outside of regular cycles. They can hold up to 10 points (or 2/3 of a typical cycle) of work, providing flexibility for cross-cycle initiatives, urgent work, or continuous improvement efforts that don't fit neatly into sprint boundaries.

## Characteristics

### 📊 Structure & Capacity
- **Point Value**: 0 points (placeholder)
- **Capacity**: Up to 10 points of child issues
- **Cycle Limit**: 2/3 of a standard cycle capacity
- **Duration**: Can span multiple cycles
- **Flexibility**: Work can be added/removed dynamically

### 🎯 Purpose
- Container for cross-cycle work
- Holder of urgent/unplanned tasks
- Continuous improvement tracking
- Technical debt management
- Support and maintenance work
- Innovation time tracking

## Types of Umbrellas

### 1. 🚨 Urgent Response Umbrella
- Critical bug fixes
- Security patches
- Production incidents
- Customer escalations
- Emergency features

### 2. 🔧 Continuous Improvement Umbrella
- Ongoing optimizations
- Technical debt reduction
- Code quality improvements
- Documentation updates
- Testing enhancements

### 3. 🔬 Innovation Umbrella
- Research and development
- Proof of concepts
- Experimental features
- Technology exploration
- Learning initiatives

### 4. 🛠️ Maintenance Umbrella
- Regular maintenance tasks
- Dependency updates
- Infrastructure upkeep
- Monitoring improvements
- Tool upgrades

### 5. 🤝 Support Umbrella
- Customer support tasks
- Bug investigations
- Performance analysis
- User assistance
- Knowledge base updates

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Umbrellas
- Work that doesn't align with cycle boundaries
- Ongoing initiatives spanning multiple cycles
- Urgent work that can't wait for next cycle
- Continuous improvement efforts
- Innovation and experimentation time
- Support and maintenance activities

### When Not to Use Umbrellas
- Regular feature development
- Work that fits within a single cycle
- Tasks with clear cycle alignment
- Standard project work
- Predictable, planned initiatives

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Creation
- Identify need for cross-cycle container
- Define umbrella purpose and scope
- Set initial capacity allocation
- Establish success criteria

### 2. Population
- Add child issues as they arise
- Track point accumulation
- Monitor capacity (10 point limit)
- Balance with cycle commitments

### 3. Management
- Regular review of contents
- Prioritize child issues
- Move completed work out
- Adjust capacity as needed

### 4. Closure
- Complete all child issues
- Document outcomes
- Measure impact
- Create new umbrella if needed

## 📊 Capacity Management

### Point Allocation
- **Maximum**: 10 points per umbrella
- **Recommended**: 6-8 points (allows flexibility)
- **Warning**: At 8 points, consider creating new umbrella
- **Full**: At 10 points, must complete work before adding

### Cycle Integration
- Umbrellas exist outside cycles
- Child issues can be assigned to cycles
- Track cycle vs umbrella work ratio
- Balance team capacity appropriately

### Milestone Relationship
- Umbrellas complement milestones
- Milestones = planned value containers
- Umbrellas = flexible value containers
- Both track different types of value delivery

## 📈 Tracking & Metrics

### Linear Integration
- Label: `type:umbrella`
- Points: Always 0
- Status: Ongoing/Active/Closed
- Child Issues: Track individually
- Custom Fields:
  - Current Capacity (X/10 points)
  - Type (Urgent/Improvement/Innovation/etc.)

### Key Metrics
- Utilization rate (points used/10)
- Completion velocity
- Value delivered
- Time to resolution
- Impact measurements

### Reporting
- Weekly capacity review
- Monthly value summary
- Quarterly impact analysis
- Annual umbrella effectiveness

## 🔗 Related Concepts

- **Milestones**: Planned value containers
- **Cycles**: Time-boxed work periods
- **Epics**: Large feature containers
- **Clusters**: Theme-based groupings
