# 🔄 Clusters

## Overview
Clusters are groups of related issues that share a common theme, goal, or technical area but don't fit into a traditional epic structure. They provide a flexible way to organize and track related work across different parts of the system.

## Characteristics

### 📊 Structure & Scope
- Collection of related issues
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Flexible grouping
- Theme-based organization

### 🎯 Purpose
- Group related work
- Track system-wide changes
- Manage cross-cutting concerns
- Coordinate multiple teams

## Types of Clusters

### 1. 🛠️ Technical Clusters
- System-wide upgrades
- Library migrations
- Security improvements
- Performance optimizations

### 2. 🎨 Feature Clusters
- Related UI/UX improvements
- Cross-module enhancements
- User journey optimizations
- Experience improvements

### 3. 🔧 Maintenance Clusters
