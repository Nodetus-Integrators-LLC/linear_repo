# Technical Debt

Technical Debt represents the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy or limited solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. This issue type tracks necessary improvements and refactoring needed in the codebase.

## Purpose

Technical Debt issues help track and manage compromises made during development that need to be addressed to maintain code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## When to Use

Create a Technical Debt issue when:
- Code needs refactoring
- Architecture needs improvement
- Dependencies need updating
- Documentation is outdated
- Test coverage is insufficient
- Performance optimizations are needed
- Security improvements are required

## Required Information

### Title Format
`[Debt] <Area> - <Brief Description>`

Example: `[Debt] Authentication - Migrate to OAuth 2.0`

### Description Template
```markdown
## Debt Description
[Clear description of the technical debt]

## Current State
[Description of current implementation]

## Desired State
[Description of ideal implementation]

## Impact
[Impact of not addressing the debt]

## Effort Estimation
- Time: [Estimated time]
- Complexity: [Low/Medium/High]
- Risk: [Low/Medium/High]

## Dependencies
[List of related systems/components]

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Specific measurable criteria]
- [ ] [Additional criteria]
```

## Debt Assessment

### Impact Levels

1. **Critical**
   - Blocking future development
   - Causing regular issues
   - Security risks
   - Performance problems
   - High maintenance cost

2. **High**
   - Slowing development
   - Occasional issues
   - Scalability concerns
   - Maintenance overhead
   - Technical limitations

3. **Medium**
   - Minor inefficiencies
   - Code smell
   - Limited impact
   - Future concern
   - Easy workaround

4. **Low**
   - Cosmetic issues
   - Minor improvements
   - Documentation updates
   - Optional optimizations
   - Nice-to-have changes

## Resolution Process

1. **Identification**
   - Recognize debt
   - Document issues
   - Assess impact
   - Estimate effort

2. **Prioritization**
   - Impact analysis
   - Cost evaluation
   - Risk assessment
   - Resource planning

3. **Planning**
   - Solution design
   - Timeline creation
   - Resource allocation
   - Dependency management

4. **Implementation**
   - Code refactoring
   - Testing
   - Documentation
   - Review process

5. **Validation**
   - Quality checks
   - Performance testing
   - Security review
   - Stakeholder approval

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation**
   - Clear description
   - Impact assessment
   - Solution proposal
   - Success criteria

2. **Prioritization**
   - Impact-based
   - Risk-aware
   - Resource-conscious
   - Timeline-sensitive

3. **Implementation**
   - Incremental changes
   - Proper testing
   - Clear communication
   - Regular updates

4. **Review**
   - Code review
   - Architecture review
   - Performance check
   - Security audit

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Poor Description**
   - "Code needs cleanup" ❌
   - "Refactor user authentication to use OAuth 2.0 for improved security" ✅

2. **Missing Impact**
   - "Old code" ❌
   - "Legacy authentication system causing weekly production issues" ✅

3. **Unclear Scope**
   - "Update everything" ❌
   - "Update all npm packages to their latest LTS versions" ✅

4. **No Success Criteria**
   - Define clear, measurable outcomes
   - Include validation steps
   - Specify acceptance criteria
