# Domain Categories

This directory contains documentation for different domain categories that represent cross-cutting concerns and specific areas of focus in software development. These domains help categorize and address various aspects of system quality, compliance, and functionality.

## Domain Overview

Our system addresses seven key domains that ensure comprehensive coverage of critical software development concerns:

### Domain Categories

```
├── Scalability
├── Auditability
├── Data
├── Legality
├── Performance
├── Requirements
└── Security
```

## Domain Descriptions

### [Scalability](./scalability)
Focuses on the system's ability to handle growth in users, data, or workload efficiently.
- System scaling capabilities
- Load handling
- Resource management
- Distributed systems
- Capacity planning

### [Auditability](./auditability)
Ensures the system maintains proper records and can track changes and actions.
- Audit trails
- Change tracking
- Activity logging
- Compliance monitoring
- Historical records

### [Data](./data)
Addresses all aspects of data management and handling within the system.
- Data structures
- Storage solutions
- Data flow
- Data integrity
- Data lifecycle

### [Legality](./legality)
Ensures compliance with legal requirements and regulations.
- Regulatory compliance
- Legal requirements
- Privacy laws
- Industry standards
- Contractual obligations

### [Performance](./performance)
Focuses on system speed, efficiency, and resource utilization.
- Response time
- Resource usage
- Optimization
- Monitoring
- Benchmarking

### [Requirements](./requirements)
Handles functional and non-functional system requirements.
- Business needs
- User requirements
- System constraints
- Feature specifications
- Acceptance criteria

### [Security](./security)
Addresses system security and protection against threats.
- Access control
- Data protection
- Threat prevention
- Security protocols
- Vulnerability management

## Cross-cutting Concerns

These domains often intersect and influence each other:

1. **Security & Data**
   - Data encryption
   - Access controls
   - Privacy protection

2. **Performance & Scalability**
   - Resource optimization
   - Load distribution
   - Capacity planning

3. **Auditability & Legality**
   - Compliance tracking
   - Legal record-keeping
   - Regulatory reporting

## Best Practices

1. **Domain Integration**
   - Consider interactions between domains
   - Address overlapping concerns
   - Maintain consistent standards

2. **Documentation**
   - Clear domain requirements
   - Implementation guidelines
   - Compliance checklist

3. **Monitoring**
   - Regular domain audits
   - Performance metrics
   - Compliance checks

4. **Risk Management**
   - Domain-specific risks
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Regular assessments

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular reviews
   - Updates to standards
   - Process refinement

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing features that touch multiple domains:

1. Review requirements for each affected domain
2. Ensure compliance with domain-specific standards
3. Document cross-domain interactions
4. Test against domain requirements
5. Maintain domain-specific metrics

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Overlooking domain interactions
2. Insufficient domain coverage
3. Inconsistent standards
4. Poor documentation
5. Lack of monitoring
