# Requirements Stage Templates

## 📋 Overview

The requirements stage is a crucial phase in our project lifecycle where we define, document, and validate project requirements. This directory contains templates and guidelines for creating comprehensive requirement documents.

## 🗂️ Template Structure

```
02_requirements/
├── README.md           # This guide
├── 02_REQUIREMENTS.md  # Main requirements template
└── examples/          # [Coming Soon] Example requirements for reference
```
