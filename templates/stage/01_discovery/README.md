# Discovery Stage Templates

Templates and structures for the Discovery phase of project development. These templates help ensure thorough exploration and documentation of initial project requirements, constraints, and opportunities. This is the extensive version, though for certain instances where the O notation is log or lower in terms of complexity or the business owner/product owner is 'god' then expedited templates may apply.

## Best Practices

### Discovery Phase Guidelines
1. **Comprehensive Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Identify all stakeholders
   - Conduct thorough interviews
   - Document all requirements
   - Validate understanding

2. **Technical Due Diligence**
   - Review existing systems
   - Assess technical constraints
   - Identify integration points
   - Document technical requirements

3. **Risk Management**
   - Identify potential risks
   - Assess impact and likelihood
   - Develop mitigation strategies
   - Document assumptions

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Clear and concise writing
   - Use provided templates
   - Include relevant diagrams
   - Maintain version control

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Incomplete Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Missing key stakeholders ❌
   - Comprehensive stakeholder mapping ✅

2. **Rushed Technical Review**
   - Surface-level analysis ❌
   - Deep technical investigation ✅

3. **Poor Documentation**
   - Vague requirements ❌
   - Specific, measurable requirements ✅

4. **Skipped Validation**
   - Assumptions without verification ❌
   - Validated requirements and findings ✅

## Deliverables Checklist

- [ ] Budget Estimates
- [ ] Next Phase Recommendations

## Success Criteria

The Discovery phase is complete when:
1. All stakeholders have been interviewed
2. Technical requirements are documented
3. Risks are identified and assessed
4. Initial project plan is created
5. Stakeholders have validated findings
6. Next phase is clearly defined
